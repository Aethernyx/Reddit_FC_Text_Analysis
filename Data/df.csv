But it is one of the most iconic places on earth - yes, for many bad reasons, but it's very rare for a city to have something so universally recognized.

And as far as public transit, it's pretty incredible how many trains you can get there.  Anyone who's ever lived in another city and ever had to rely on public transit can attest to how useful it is to have a main transfer hub.  Even if it's crowded and kind of annoying to get around, I'll take it any day over having a system where all the lines only converge on the main downtown area.",2019-01-03 15:51:31,
